I. Introduction to CSS
A. What is CSS?
CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It defines how elements should be displayed on the screen, in print, or spoken by screen readers.

Code Sample:

css
Copy code
/* Sample CSS Rule */
body {
  font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
  color: #333;
  background-color: #f8f8f8;
}
B. Importance of Separating Structure (HTML) from Presentation (CSS)
Separating HTML structure from CSS presentation enhances maintainability, scalability, and reusability. It allows developers to make style changes without altering the HTML, fostering a clear distinction between content and design.

C. CSS Syntax and Basic Rules
CSS syntax involves selectors and declarations. Selectors target HTML elements, while declarations define how those elements should be styled.

Code Sample:

css
Copy code
/* CSS Declaration Block */
h1 {
  color: #3498db;
  font-size: 28px;
}






II. Selectors and Declarations
A. Understanding CSS Selectors
Selectors determine which elements a style rule applies to. They can target HTML elements, classes, IDs, or other attributes.

Code Sample:

css
Copy code
/* Selecting Elements by Type */
p {
  color: #555;
}

/* Selecting Elements by Class */
.button {
  background-color: #e74c3c;
}
B. Applying Styles with Declarations
Declarations set the style properties for the selected elements.

Code Sample:

css
Copy code
/* Declaration Block */
h2 {
  font-family: 'Verdana', sans-serif;
  font-weight: bold;
}
C. Specificity and the Importance of the Cascade
Specificity determines which style rule takes precedence when conflicts arise. The cascade defines the order of importance, allowing styles to cascade from more general to more specific.

III. CSS Box Model
A. Understanding the Box Model
The box model represents the layout of an element, comprising content, padding, border, and margin.

Code Sample:

css
Copy code
/* Box Model Properties */
div {
  width: 200px;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 2px solid #3498db;
  margin: 10px;
}
B. Applying Styles to Manipulate Box Model Properties
Styles can be applied to alter the dimensions, padding, border, and margin of an element.

Code Sample:

css
Copy code
/* Manipulating Box Model Properties */
article {
  width: 80%;
  padding: 15px;
  border-radius: 10px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
IV. Colors and Backgrounds
A. Specifying Colors in CSS
Colors can be specified using names, hexadecimal values, or RGB notation.

Code Sample:

css
Copy code
/* Specifying Colors */
button {
  background-color: #27ae60;
  color: white;
}
B. Adding Background Colors and Images
Backgrounds can be styled with solid colors or images.

Code Sample:

css
Copy code
/* Background Styles */
header {
  background-color: #ecf0f1;
  background-image: url('background.jpg');
}
C. Utilizing Gradients
Gradients create smooth transitions between colors.

Code Sample:

css
Copy code
/* Gradient Background */
section {
  background: linear-gradient(to right, #3498db, #2980b9);
}
V. Fonts and Text Styling
A. Changing Font Family, Size, and Style
Text properties, such as font family, size, and style, can be adjusted.

Code Sample:

css
Copy code
/* Text Styling */
body {
  font-family: 'Helvetica', sans-serif;
  font-size: 16px;
  font-weight: normal;
}
B. Adjusting Text Alignment and Spacing
Text alignment and spacing contribute to better readability.

Code Sample:

css
Copy code
/* Text Alignment and Spacing */
p {
  text-align: justify;
  line-height: 1.5;
  letter-spacing: 1px;
}
C. Text Decoration and Transformation
Decorative styles, like underlining or capitalization, can be applied to text.

Code Sample:

css
Copy code
/* Text Decoration and Transformation */
a {
  text-decoration: none;
}

h3 {
  text-transform: uppercase;
}
